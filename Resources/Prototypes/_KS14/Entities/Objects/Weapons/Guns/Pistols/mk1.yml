  description: The first prototype of the Mk58, the Mk1 is a rather outdated semi-automatic pistol with a simple recoil-operated action, lacking the major improvements in both accuracy and firing speed made by the later models. Its simple design makes it a favorite among more illicit manufacturers. Feeds from .35 pistol magazines.
