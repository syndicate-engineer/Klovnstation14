<!-- READ THIS BEFORE CONTRIBUTING TO KS14!!!
The REUSE Specification headers or separate .license files indicate a secondary license (if any, but e.g., the MPL or MIT licenses) alongside the AGPL, solely to facilitate
integration for projects that do not fall under a single license.

REUSE headers will be automatically added via github workflow. You can edit the SPDX-License-Identifier to change the license that the file is specified as having.
SPDX license identifiers already included in files relevant to the PR, or identifiers that were manually changed after being automatically added, will not be modified by the bot.

For clarity: You are recommended to have PR-relevant upstream-original (wizden's) files be licensed as MIT. KS14 uses the MPL license for content original to KS14.
This individual comment block can be safely removed, but you must preserve the below comment block specifying the default license of this PR.

Uncomment and modify the following line if you wish to change the auto-added license from the default of MPL. Set to `AGPL` for AGPL-3.0-or-later, `MPL` for MPL-2.0, and `MIT` for MIT.
